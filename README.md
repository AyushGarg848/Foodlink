# 🍽️ Foodlink – Donate Food & Essentials with Ease
## 📱 About the App

**Foodlink** is an Android app designed to reduce food and essential item wastage by connecting **donors** (like restaurants, event organizers, individuals) with **receivers** (such as NGOs, orphanages, or anyone in need). Instead of throwing away surplus food, users can donate it through the app, enabling better resource utilization and supporting communities in need.
